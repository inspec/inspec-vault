# Plugin Definition file
# The purpose of this file is to declare to InSpec what plugin_types (capabilities)
# are included in this plugin, and provide hooks that will load them as needed.

# It is important that this file load successfully and *quickly*.
# Your plugin's functionality may never be used on this InSpec run; so we keep things
# fast and light by only loading heavy things when they are needed.

# Presumably this is light
